    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The trick to restaurant-style sweet potatoes fries is to not cut them too thin and to not over-fill the basket when cooking.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>600g sweet potatoes, about 3 small, peeled</li>
        <li>20g cornflour</li>
        <li>half tsp onion granules</li>
        <li>half tsp garlic granules</li>
        <li>half tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>      
    </ul>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the air-fryer to 200C.</li>
        <li>Cut the sweet potatoes into chips no smaller than 1cm thick.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, stir together the cornflour, onion and garlic granules, paprika and plenty of salt and black pepper. Add the sweet potato and toss until well coated.</li>
        <li>Tip out any excess cornflour before pouring over the oil, ensuring all the chips are coated.</li>
        <li> Add the sweet potato fries to the air-fryer in an even layer. Cook for 25-30 mins, turning the chips over after 20mins.</li>
        <li>When the sweet potato fries are well browned and tender, carefully lift out into a serving bowl. The fries will crisp up further as they cool slightly.</li>
    </ol>
